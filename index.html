    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Playing Piano - I like playing piano because it gives me a way to express
        emotions, and the satisfaction of hearing yourself make something sound good
        is unparalleled.
    </li>
    <li>Basketball - I love basketball because it's my favorite form of cardio, and
        playing with friends and family is something i just really enjoy.
    </li>
    <li>Gym - Out of all my hobbies i'd definetly say lifting weights is my favorite. Pushing your boundaries everytime
        you step into the gym and watching yourself get better and stronger day by day is so exciting for me. Transforming your
        body and staying healthy is something that's massively important to me and i will continue to do it everyday.

<h2>excerpt from indiana jones</h2>

<div>
    <p>"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.
         I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London.
          One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.
           There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get 
           the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had 
           been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself 
           as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured 
           plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly 
           as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my 
           surprise that I had received no 
           less than 26s. 4d.</p>

    <p>"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ 
        served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's 
        grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten 
        days I had the money and had paid the debt.</p>
    
    <p>"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much
         in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between
          my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had
           first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the 
           keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the
            evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so 
            that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.</p>
